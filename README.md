# Web-Viewer-KDE-Widget

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is no longer maintained. I have ceased all updates and support for this project. It's source code is quite simple so feel free to fork it if you want to create your own version. But I will not be providing any support in that regards, since I no longer use KDE nor this widget.

Add a webpage on your desktop. With options for auto refresh, audio muting, disabling scrolling. The widget border is turned off by default, but there is an option to add it back under: `Rotate | Configure ... | Show Background`.
